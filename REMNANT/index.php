				After my mother gave birth to me at her elder sister�s place at age 16, she went and got married to my then father who was
         57years old as a third wife. Life was so enjoyable and everything was available for me and my mother since she was the most beloved wife.
         <br><br>
				At age 4 our beautiful life changed to hell after the death of my then father and the birth of my younger sister.
         Though my first mum loved us very much but, she had no power in that home because of her barrenness.
          All the powers were in the hand of my second mum. Together with her children she made a plan to molest us.
           The step brother did everything to make sure that I, 
           my mum and my younger sister went through all the possible hell under the sun. 
           We used to go for a week without food and we use to survive with guava,
            sugarcane and water as our meals since there was none to pay my schoolfee, 
            my work was to sit back at home and receive the mistreatments from my then elder cousins.
				<br><br>
				In 2002 the Lord opened for me the way through the then president Mwai Kibaki who introduced 
        free primary education. I did my KCPE in the year 2011 and passed. Due to the facts that I had no 
        one to support my education, I decided to go search for a job. Luckily I got one and I was employed to work as
         a shepherd the job that helped in shaping my attentiveness and through my good work my boss admitted me to a 
         nearby secondary school. I did my form two and by God�s grace my step aunt narrated my situation to her daughter.
          She promised to transfer me to Ringa Boys high school where I did my final exam. Though I was discourage because
           I only missed direct entry to public university by a point but I kept on trusting in the Lord for the miracle.
			<br><br>
			After few days off disappointment, I had that, the government was admitting students with B- of 53points and 
      above to private university. Three days before the deadline I manage to apply and that is how I got admitted to 
      Daystar University.
